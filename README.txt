================

- Jello spring physics for Structural, Shear and Bend springs
- Bounding Box collisions
- Inclined Plane collisions (and show the inclined plane)
- Force field functionality (added as gravitational force in the world file submission)
- Interactively push the jello using Left Mouse button click. The jello is pushed away in the direction the camera is looking, as long as the left mouse button is held. The camera can also be rotated while holding to keep pushing from different angles.
- "world.w" file to demonstrate all functionalities

Running "JelloCube.exe world.w" while in the directory in command line should work
You can also just double-click the "JelloCube" shortcut file, which should automatically load world.w
